# Coffee_Shop_Sales_Dashboard

## $${\color{lightgreen}Project \space Introduction:}$$ 

This project provides the sales insights along with different KPIs reflecting the business growth, details about the strong and weak performing areas by utilizing an "Excel Dashboard" for sales information. The Dashboard provides analytical summary numbers, charts, metrics and information about the KPIs showcasing the performance/trajectory of current business operations as well as provides insightful data in order to improve the overall business processes and model of the coffee shop.

The goal of analysing the Transaction data within this project is to get important insights regarding revenue generation from sales, customer behaviour, monthly growth of business, sales growth about different categories, product popularity, quantity sold on monthly/weekday basis, sales patterns, operational efficiencies of various retail stores and their revenue generation.

The broad objective and purpose of performing this project is to analyse the growth of business in terms of revenue generation, analysing the number of customers or user-base coming to the shop, optimizing inventory management according to the best and worst selling products, prioritizing the working hours, days, months according to the peak sale times while at the same time improving/optimizing the business operations during the odd working hours, days, months when it doesn't attract much sales/customers, to improve the decision making processes by analysing the consumer purchasing patterns and 'Understanding the Buying Mind'.

#### _**Project Tasks:**_

-> Data Collection, Cleaning of Data, Preparing and Organizing Data using Power Query Editor.<br>
-> Understanding the different variables in the dataset and generating new variables from them required for analysis.<br>
-> Analysis of monthly, daily, and hourly sales patterns with Power PivotTables.<br>
-> Analysing distribution of different product categories and product types.<br>
-> Analysing the peak performing hours, days, months, store locations, product categories and product types.<br>
-> Checking the total footfall of the overall business as well as of individual store locations.<br>
-> Analysing the total quantity ordered/consumed based on different hours in various months and days.<br>
-> Using Power PivotTables tables, Measures and DAX functions to create various elements of the Dashboard.<br>
-> Developing Interactive Dashboard with compelling reports, KPIs, figures and attractive visualization.

#### _**Key Findings and Conclusions:**_

1. Most of the transactions occur between 8:00 am and 10:00 am with maximum transactions occurring at around 10:00 am clearly depicting a morning rush hour of customers.
2. Highest quantity of orders are also placed between 8:00 am and 10:00 am with maximum order quantity occurring at 10:00 am.
3. Lowest transactions as well as lowest quantity of orders placed occur between 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm.
4. Coffee is highest performing product category with total 39% of product share/revenue followed by Tea with 28% product share/revenue.
5. Barista Espresso is highest performing product type with total revenue of $91,406 followed by Brewed Chai Tea with total revenue of $77,082.
6. Regular is most selling Portion Size (31%) among different Sizes followed by Large (30%) and Small is the least preferred portion size (9%).
7. Monday, Thursday, and Friday have high transaction volumes approx. equal to 21.7K, depicting a greater customer visits and engagement on these days.
8. While Saturday has the least transaction volumes among all the days despite being a weekend followed by Sunday which has the 2nd lowest transaction volumes.
9. Thus, analysing the transaction data on various days concludes that there is more volume of customers on Weekdays compared to Weekends (i.e. Saturday and Sunday).
10. Lower Manhattan shows the lowest sales and footfall than other stores while Hell's Kitchen comes at the top with highest sales and footfall.

#### _**Final Conclusion from the Analysis:**_

So, by performing the thorough data analysis and visualization using an Excel Interactive Dashboard in this project, we have been able to analyse the key insights for optimizing the business operations and processes of the coffee shop and its stores/outlets. Peak transaction times and rush hours, highest quantity of items consumed, best performing product categories and their types, preferred portion sizes, strong and weak performing days as well as room for improvement in the Lower Manhattan Store and low sale volume on weekends are some of the key points that have been identified.

Therefore, by using these key metrics/KPIs and findings/statistics, the key stakeholders and business owners can enhance their business operations with enriching customer experiences and can develop optimized inventory management systems to amplify the overall Sales for a thriving coffee shop business.
